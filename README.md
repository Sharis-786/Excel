<h3> Overview </h3>
If you like playing around Excel as much as I do, then peek in. When it comes to big data, Excel is not my go to tool for data analysis and dashboarding. Other than that, Excel is a very powerful tool and eases up alot of computation on data. I personally find Excel very handy for Analysis and Dashboarding. First, you have to have good cognititve ability, Second, be creative.

<h3> Important concepts </h3>

1. Basic formulas and functions
2. Vlookup(frequently used), Hlookup(not much used), Xlookup(Available in newer versions)
3. Index, Match (Very, very powerful)
4. Conditional statements (if, ifs, switch etc)
5. Pivot, PowerPivot
6. Data Validation
7. Charts and formatting
8. Conditional formatting
9. Sorting, filtering
10. VBA and Macros (not required for data analysis)

<h3> Steps to follow before jumping to build Dashboard: </h3>
Create 4-5 sheets in 1 workbook, namely: Raw Data, Modified Data, Assets, Calculations, Dashboard
<h4> Definitions </h4>
<strong>Raw Data</strong>: This sheet will contain your original data. Don't make any changes to this sheet. <br>
<strong>Modified Data</strong>: Here, clean your data, modify it as per your requirement for analysis. <br>
<strong>Assets</strong>: Keep the logo or icons or color pallets or images or maps or themes etc that you will be using in your dashboard. <br>
<strong>Calculations</strong>: Do all your calculations here. Keep your pivot tables and respective calculations here. <br>
<strong>Dashboard</strong>: Make your final dashboard here (try to make it as dynamic as it can be) <br><br>


<strong>Note</strong>: <i>Must keep copy of original data somehwhere</i> <br>

<h3>Now that you're ready, let's harness the power of Excel!</h3>
